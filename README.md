## Building

[emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) must be installed before building the project.

```
$ git submodule update --recursive --init
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make -j4
```

## Running the example via emrun
`emrun` is included in the `emsdk`. It starts up a web server to view the example. After building, from the `build` directory, run
```
$ emrun index.html
```
